# 📉 Customer Churn Rate Analysis (Excel Dashboard)

---

## 📌 Overview  
This project explores **customer churn analysis** using an interactive **Excel dashboard**.  
The goal is to track churn patterns, identify customer segments most at risk, and provide insights that can guide customer retention strategies.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Measure and visualize the **customer churn rate** over time.  
- Segment churn by different customer groups (e.g., demographics, usage, plan type).  
- Highlight key risk areas contributing to higher churn.  
- Build an easy-to-use Excel dashboard for stakeholders to interact with.  

---

## 📂 Data Source  
- Customer dataset (subscriptions, cancellations, and usage information).  
- Data cleaned and transformed in Excel prior to analysis.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques  
- **Microsoft Excel**  
  - Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts  
  - Conditional Formatting  
  - Excel Formulas (e.g., `IF`, `VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP`, `COUNTIFS`)  
  - Slicers & Timelines for interactivity  

---

## ⚙️ Methodology  
1. **Data Cleaning** – removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting data.  
2. **Churn Calculation** – defined churn rate using:  
   \[
   \text{Churn Rate} = \frac{\text{Customers Lost}}{\text{Total Customers at Start}} \times 100
   \]  
3. **Segmentation** – applied filters and slicers to break down churn by time, customer category, or plan type.  
4. **Dashboard Design** – created a professional Excel dashboard with clear KPIs, trendlines, and interactive charts.

## 🔑 Key Insights  
- Churn rate shows fluctuations across the observed time periods.  
- Some customer groups (specific plans or usage patterns) show significantly higher churn.  
- Retention is stronger among certain segments, suggesting targeted engagement strategies could reduce churn.
